For this assignment I gathered data on wildlife encountered at Dunbar Cave State Park. Collected data inclues timestamp, latitude, longitude, Collector, Taxonomic Group, Name, and Pet Factor. Pet factor is a value from 1-5 that quantifies the pettability of an animal. This highly scientific measurement (Edelkind, J.L., 2023) is calculated by assessing the physical appearance of the animal, how much harm could be done by petting the animal, and the innate desire of the Collector to pet the animal. <br> <br>
